# Stardew Outfit Manager

A wardrobe management mod for Stardew Valley that replaces the default dresser menu with a more visual, outfit-focused interface.

## What It Does

When you interact with a dresser, instead of the standard shop-style menu, you get a three-tab wardrobe system that makes it easier to put together outfits and save your favorites.

The **Wardrobe** tab gives you a visual clothing picker. You see your farmer in a live preview on the left, and you can cycle through all the hats, shirts, pants, shoes, and rings in your dresser using arrow buttons. Pick a seasonal category, put together a look you like, and save it as a favorite.

The **Favorites** tab is where your saved outfits live. Each outfit shows up as a card with a preview of what the farmer looks like wearing it. Outfits are organized by season—Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter, or Special—so you can keep your beach looks separate from your winter festival gear. Click an outfit to preview it, then equip it with one button. If any pieces are missing from your dresser (maybe you sold those pants), the outfit shows as unavailable until you get them back.

The **Dresser** tab is your dresser's inventory, similar to the vanilla menu but with category filters for quickly finding what you're looking for.

The mod remembers your preferences as you use it—which tab you were on, which season you had selected, which direction your farmer was facing in the preview. It also works in multiplayer, with each player having their own saved outfits and dresser access handled properly so you're not fighting over the same furniture.
